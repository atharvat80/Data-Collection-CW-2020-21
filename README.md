For the data science sub-module we had to use scrape relevant information from BBC news and use NLP on the scraped data to find the semantic distance between the given list of keywords. 
For this task I used a TF-IDF vector to convert the scraped data into vector form and calculate the cosine distance to measure the semantic distance.

An example visualisation of what can be created using this script is shown below
